        <center>Snakes and ladders is a board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic.[1] The
            game originated in ancient India as Moksha Patam, and was brought to the United Kingdom in the 1890s. It is
            played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on
            the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game
            piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing
            ladders but hindered by falling down snakes.
